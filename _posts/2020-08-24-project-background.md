At the start to this Summer, I began thinking about how Icould use my skills 
as an Electrical Engineering student to interact with my community. I thought
about the possibility of designing and building consumer electronics that 
could be sold at the Farmer's Market. This would be an interesting way to
bypass large corporate entities and might even provide benefits such as 
lower-cost, highly customizable product.

I began planning out the project and identified the major components that would
be necessary and quickly realized that I could benefit from a rigorous 
methodology for coordinating and managing the design of this Bluetooth speaker.
Systems Engineering is a field that has its beginnings in the aerospace/defense
industries, and its modern tools and methods are now utilized in a wide range of
areas, from Commercial Product Design to nonconventional areas such as political
decision making.
